Version 0.4.x
=============

- save tco-settings in trackContentWidget::saveSettings() etc. instead of 
  track::...
- resample sample-track-tcos when exporting at different samplerate
- message to user when importing unsupported MIDI-file (track-count = 0)
- piano roll: mouse cursor isn't updated correctly in selection mode
  (from resizing note edit area)
- when you add vestige, have it automatically pop the find VST plugin dialog
- try to make vestige-plugin-dlls relative
- select all MIDI devices by default when you bring up the "connect to controller"
  window and wait for first event - then uncheck all other MIDI devices that no
  events were detected from
- load asdlol.mmpz. if you render it without playing it, or if you play it
  the first time, you hear unwanted artifacts. (solution: apply automation
  before playing)
- autosave every 30s (configurable!) and offer recovery at startup after crash
- speed up painting of sampleTCO
- do not process effects when playing frozen patterns
- copy-pasted automation patterns have to be manually linked back to
  their knob for some reason
- improve TrackLabelButton: split 80%-20% (80%=name, 20%=button showing a popup
  menu with track operations, make the midi input a top-level menu item)
- when you click and drag a mixer bar, it doesn't click and drag, it sets
  absolutely. this is annoying
